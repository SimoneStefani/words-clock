A words clock is a device consisting of a display area where specific words appear according to the current time. A typical displayed phrase can be “IT IS TWENTY MINUTES PAST TWELVE” and every five minutes the time is updated. Two buttons allow the user to manually update hours and minutes.

Construction, electronic circuit and progam of the clock are accurately described in the [Words Clock Manual](wordclock_manual.pdf).
